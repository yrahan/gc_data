To run run_analysis.R
1- put it in your working directory
2- put UCI_HAR_Dataset.zip in your working directory
3- the result will be in YOUR_WORKING_DIR/output/tidy_data.txt

Please, install missing packages to your environnement if needed.
The script works fine under linux (ubuntu) You may need to adapt some parts if in a different environnement, but it should be fine.

Hope you 'll appreciate my work.
Thanks and have fun.
